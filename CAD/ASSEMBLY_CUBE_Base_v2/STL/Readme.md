# BASE CUBE - 3D printing
([TUT01 of TUTORIALS](../../../TUTORIALS))

## Parts

### <img src="./IMAGES/P.png" width=40>3D printing parts
The Cube consists of the following components:

* **The Cube Body** where all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place - insert that define the function of the cube are placed in the body before closing the lid ([Cube-BASE](10_Cube_1x1_v2.stl))
* **The Lid** that closes the cube. It is attached by four screws.  ([Cube-LID](10_Lid_1x1_v2.stl))

The `.stl` files can be directly printed using off-the-shelf 3D printer.

An archive with all the files can be found [here](BASECUBE_v2.zip).

* Check out the [RESOURCES](../../../TUTORIALS/RESOURCES) for more information!
* 4× DIN912 M3×12 screws (galvanized steel)
* 4× DIN912 M3×8 screws (galvanized steel) - or use 8× M3×12

### 3D printer settings

* Quality: Normal, 0,15 mm layer height
* Support: None
* Infill: 20%
* Adhesion: None if possible, otherwise brim
* Material: ABS/PLA
* Printing time: ~2:30 h

1. Download both .stl files - 10_Cube_1x1_v2.stl and 10_Lid_1x1_v2.stl or download and extract the BASECUBE_v2.zip.
1. Place the files in your slicer and use the above setting. Leave the rest of the settings as default or based on the experience you have with your printer.
1. Slice it, save it, print it!
1. Next: [🢂 Assembly](../#assembly-video-tutorial)

## Confusion about version v0 vs. version v2

We made a change in the CAD design of the cube in order to be more generic (e.g. point symmetry around the center). We're trying hard to update the APPlications so that everything is based on the new design, but it's a lot of files and there are probably still some forgotten v0 parts.

If you're unsure, check out the [Modular Developer Kit](../MDK) - there you find a general definition of the shape and size of the inserts which is up to date!

The outer cube dimensions stayed the same, but the inserts changed completely!

[HERE](./V0) you find the old cube - just as a reference!
