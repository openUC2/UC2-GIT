## Applications
<a href="#icon01" name="icon01"><img src="../IMAGES/signpost.png" width=30></a> Here you can find all the optical setups we tested or proposed so far.

* For printing and assembly of all the cubes and modules go to [CAD](../CAD)
* For setups compilations go to [TheBOX](../TheBOX)
* For beginner's tutorials, how-to guides and more guidelines go to [TUTORIALS](../TUTORIALS)
* For information on the electronic parts go to [ELECTRONICS](../ELECTRONICS)
* For information on the software go to the dedicated repository [UC2-Software-GIT](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT)
* For the Bill of Materials go to [RESOURCES](../TUTORIALS/RESOURCES)
* For anything else, have a look at the [SITEMAP](../SITEMAP.md)

This is a growing list of available optical setups coming along with tutorials and alignment instructions. The most important part is the core building block as you find in every modular toolbox. A detailed description of the the **UC2** cube can be found [here](../CAD/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base_v2/Readme.md).

## General Naming Convention and Structure of UC2

## UC2 version history
When you search through the repository, you find that not all the images show the same cubes and baseplates. This is due to the evolution of the basic building blocks. In order to help you not to get lost, in the [Modular Developer Kit](../MDK#uc2-version-history) is a short explanation of how the cubes evolved.

#### v3 = 3D-printed AND Injection Moulded (*November 2020*)
This is the current version. The cube comes in two versions that are fully compatible with each other. You can either print all the baseplates and cubes and assemble and connect them using screws and magnets, or you can use the IM cubes and baseplate puzzles that connect via the lego-like pins.

The IM cube is shown on the left, the 3DP (3D-printed) cube is on the right. Find the details about the base cube in [ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base](./ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base).

A list of available Cubes that are the building blocks of all our setups can be found in [CAD](../CAD).
