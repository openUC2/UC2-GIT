 ## [Applications](./APPLICATIONS)

 [HERE](./APPLICATIONS) you find all the setups that have already been built.

 ## [CAD](./CAD)

 [HERE](./CAD) you find all the cubes and modules that are the building blocks of the [setups](./APPLICATIONS).  
 Each cube has its own:

 * function description
 * list of 3D printed parts (STL folders)
 * list of additional components that you need to buy
 * assembly tutorial


 ## [Electronics](./ELECTRONICS)

 [HERE](./ELECTRONICS) you will find guidelines for the electronic parts that are used in several cubes and other related stuff.  
 The discussed topics are:

 * [Z-stage and Sample-Stage](./ELECTRONICS/Z-Stage)
 * [LED matrix](./ELECTRONICS/LED-Matrix)
 * [Fluo-LED for Z-stage](./ELECTRONICS/FLUO-LED)
 * [XY-Stage](./ELECTRONICS/XY-Stage)
 * [Raspberry Pi](./ELECTRONICS/RASPBERRY-PI)
 * [Magnetic connectors (v0)](./ELECTRONICS/Magnetic-Connectors)


 There is also a simplified guide [Electronics for dummies](./ELECTRONICS/ELECTRONICS_FOR_DUMMIES).


 ## [MDK](./MDK)

 [HERE](./MDK) you find the Modular Developer Kit. If you want to adapt your ideas to the UC2 framework the Modular Developer Kit gives you the necessary steps in order to do so. We provide detailed description of the definitions, intentions and files. There you also find the templates and CAD drawings.

 ## [Software](./SOFTWARE)

All software can be found in the dedicated [UC2-Software-GIT](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT) repository.  
There is also a dedicated [UC2+ImJoy Image Processing](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-ImJoy-Plugins) repository.

 ## [The BOX](./TheBOX)

 [HERE](./TheBOX) you find our BOXes. The BOX is a comprehensive toolbox that contains a given set of cubes and can be used for a series of experiments.  
 Currently, we have three levels:

 * [SimpleBOX](./TheBOX/SimpleBOX) for schools and demonstration of basic optical principles
 * [FullBOX](./TheBOX/FullBOX) for adventurous biologists and microscopy enthusiasts
 * [CourseBOX](./TheBOX/CourseBOX) for Basic Microscopy and Optical Alignment courses


 ## [Tutorials](./TUTORIALS)

 [HERE](./TUTORIALS) you find a step-by-step guidelines that will lead you through the UC2 toolbox. From the level of total beginners you can follow the steps to become a contribute or spread the idea in your school or research institution.  
 The guidelines are divided into sections:

 * [First steps](./TUTORIALS#-first-steps) - getting familiar with hardware and software
 * [Tutorials](./TUTORIALS#-tutorials) - detailed guidelines for your first steps through UC2
 * [How-to guides](./TUTORIALS#-how-to-guides) - advanced guidelines for UC2 users
 * [References](./TUTORIALS#-reference-guides) - links to related topics


 Also in the TUTORIALS folder:

* [RESOURCES](./TUTORIALS/RESOURCES) of components we use
  * Find a complete shopping'n'printing list including estimated prices for all modules and setups in this [GoogleDrive Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1MndGKRCs0LKE5W8VGreCv9DJbQVQv7O6kgLlB6ZmE/edit?usp=sharing)
* [DATASHEETS](./TUTORIALS/DATASHEETS) of components we use


 ## [Workshop](./WORKSHOP)

 [HERE](./WORKSHOP) you find a collection of ready-to-use workshops based on the modular optics system UC2. It's in the form of documentation of the workshops we already gave.  
 The documented workshops are:

 * [In-line holography](./WORKSHOP/INLINE-HOLOGRAMM)
 * [Light sheet microscopy](./WORKSHOP/LIGHTSHEET)
 * [Comprehensive 2-day workshop](./WORKSHOP/OSLO)
 * [Short FullBOX workshop](./WORKSHOP/TiM2020)
 * [Simple Telescopes](./APPLICATIONS/APP_SIMPLE-Telescope)
 * [SimpleBOX](./TheBOX/SimpleBOX)
 * [CourseBOX](./TheBOX/CourseBOX)
