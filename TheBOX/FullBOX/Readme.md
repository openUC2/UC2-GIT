# Full BOX

The FullBOX is the home off all possible experiments that can be built using the UC2 toolbox. Therefore, the actual content changes from time to time.

## Watch [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey4uEFEG6MY) how to build a bright field and light sheet microscope from the BOX in less than 5 minutes! 

That's how it could look like:

Useful for Workshops. Get back to us if you want to organize one together with us!
