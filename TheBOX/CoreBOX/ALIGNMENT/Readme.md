# The Core BOX Alignment Procedure

### First experiment: Finite-corrected Microscope with Köhler Illumination
This experiment demonstrates the essential parts of a microscope and explains the concept of conjugate planes. The key components are: Light source, Collector lens, Field Diaphragm, Aperture Diaphragm, Condenser lens, Sample, Objective lens and Eyepiece lens.

### Second experiment: Abbe Diffraction Experiment
The famous Abbe Diffraction Experiments shows how diffraction of light by a specimen (and interference with the illuminating light) creates an image and how collection of diffracted light defines the resolution of the microscope. With this setup it is possbile to view both sets of conjugate planes at the same time, with one's eye or a camera.

We propose to use a diffraction grating as a sample and spatial filter in the BFP.

1. Start with 1×13 baseplate and all the cubes:

* Flashlight Cube (1)
* Collector Lens Cube (2)
* 2× Circular Aperture Cube (3)
* Condenser Lens Cube (4)
* Sample Cube (5)
* Objective Lens Cube (6)
* Objective in Z-Stage Cube (7)
* Eyepiece Lens Cube (8)
* 4× Screen Cube - 1× with white paper, 3× with lens tissue (9)

</p>
2. Start by placing the sample - we will build the microscope around it.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_02.jpg" width="500">
</p>
3. Place the Primary Image Plane (PIP) by definition: the distance is 200 mm from sample to PIP when using the 4× objective (finite-corrected for 160 mm, 40 mm working distance). Use the Sample cube with white paper as a screen.
<p align="center">

<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_04.jpg" width="500">
</p>


4. Place the objective lens. It is a single plano-convex lense with *f'* = 35 mm.  
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_05.jpg" width="500">
</p>

5. Use direct illumination from the flashlight with! its lens. Adjust the position of the objective lens - focus the image on PIP by moving the lens back or forth.

* **Focussing Trick:** Firstly move the whole objective lens cube in one direction (away from the sample). If the image sharpness in PIP improves, slide the insert in that direction. If the image sharpness in PIP get worse, slide the insert in the opposite direction, towards the sample. Continue until you get a focussed image of your sample on the PIP.

<p align="center">

</p>

6. Place the eyepiece lens behind the PIP. It is a single plano-convex lense with *f'* = 40 mm. Exchange the PIP screen with a semitransparent screen (lens tissue). While looking through the eyepiece, focus it on the PIP. Use the Focussing Trick again. The position within the cube of the sample holder for the paper screen and for the semitransparent screen has to be identical.

<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_08.jpg" height="375">
</p>
7. Take away the screen from PIP. To dim the flashlight, put a piece of lens tissue in front of it. Look through the eyepiece - you should see a sharp image of your sample.  
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_10.jpg" width="500">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_11.jpg" height="375">
</p>
8. Place the Field Diaphragm (FD). The position was chosen in order to work well with the availible lenses.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_12.jpg" width="500">
</p>


9. Place the condenser lens. It is a single plano-convex lense with *f'* = 40 mm.  
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_13.jpg" width="500">
</p>
10. Place the PIP screen back to its position.  
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_14.jpg" width="500">
</p>
11. Place the flashlight on one end of the baseplate.  Close the FD.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_15.jpg" width="500">
</p>
12. Adjust the position of the condenser lens - focus the image of the FD on PIP by moving the lens back or forth (Focussing Trick). Once you see a sharp image of the closed FD on the screen in PIP, open and close the aperture and observe its effect.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_16.jpg" height="375">
</p>
13. Remove the screen, look throught the eyepiece and check whether you see a sharp image of the closed FD.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_17.jpg" height="375">
</p>

14. Place the Aperture Diaphragm (AD) into the Front Focal Plane (FFP) of the condenser lens (40 mm).


* **Focal Plane Trick** - In case you don't know where exactly the FFP is, use this:
* Use the Laser Cube with Beam Expander Cube to produce a collimated beam. Place the condenser lens in the collimated beam and find focus.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_18.jpg" width="500">
</p>

* Place the AD into the same plane - slide in within the cube. Careful - push the Aperture from one side to keep it together.

</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_21.jpg" width="500">
</p>

15. Remove the lens of the flashlight. The position of the flashlight remains.
<p align="center">

</p>


16. Place the collector lens. It is a single plano-convex lense with *f'* = 50 mm.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_23.jpg" width="500">
</p>
17. Remove the FD. Close the AD. Center the flashlight with respect to the AD. Focus the image of the LED on the AD by adjusting the position of the collector lens (Focussing Trick).
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_24.jpg" width="500">
</p>
18. Place the FD back in the illumination path. Now the Köhler illumination is properly aligned.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_25.jpg" width="500">
</p>
19. Place a semitransparent screen into the Back Focal Plane (BFP) of the objective lens. Close the AD and check that you see a focussed image of the AD in the BFP.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_26.jpg" width="500">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_27.jpg" height="375">
</p>
20. Remove all screens. Use a lens tissue to dim the light and look through the eyepiece. Observe the effect of opening and closing the apertures.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_28.jpg" width="500">
</p>

* Left: both apertures open. Middle: FD closed. Right: AD closed.

</p>

21. Exhange objective lens with 4× objective in Z-Stage. Place a screen in PIP and observe the effect of opening and closing the apertures in the PIP.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_32.jpg" width="500">

22. Remove the screen. **This is an aligned finite-corrected microscope with Köhler illumination**.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_36.jpg" width="500">
</p>


23. By adding 4 more cubes and another baseplate, we will now create the **Abbe Difraction Experiment**. The extra cubes are:

* Beamsplitter Cube (1)
* Mirror 45° Cube (2)
* Eyepiece Lens Cube (different *f'* than the previously used one!) (3)
* Relay Lens Cube (4)

<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_37.jpg" height="375">
</p>
24. Remove the eyepiece (40 mm) and add the 4×2 baseplate. Exchange the 4× objective with the objective lens (35 mm).
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_38.jpg" width="500">
</p>
25. Place the Beamsplitter Cube.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_39.jpg" height="375">
</p>

26. Place the screen into the PIP, in front of the Beamsplitter. Place a new eyepiece lens behind the Beamsplitter. It is a single plano-convex lense with *f'* = 100 mm. While looking through the eyepiece, focus it on the PIP (Focussing Trick).
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_40.jpg" height="375">
</p>
27. In the other arm we will observe the BFP. There are two options, depending on how you place the Mirror in the next step.

* Option 1: Place the mirror as shown in the picture.
* Place the eyepiece lens (40 mm).

<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_41.jpg" height="375">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_42.jpg" height="375">
</p>

* Option 2: Place the mirror as shown in the picture.
* Place the baseplate connector on the mirror cube.
* Place the eyepiece cube (40 mm) on the connector on the mirror cube.

28. Place the relay lens after the Beamsplitter. It is a single plano-convex lense with *f'* = 75 mm.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_46.jpg" height="375">
</p>
29. Place a semitransparent screen in the BFP of the objective lens. Close AD and look through the eyepiece of the side arm. You should see a sharp image of the AD on the BFP.
<p align="center">
<img src="./IMAGES/UC2_coreBOX_alignment_47.jpg" height="375">
</p>

30. **This is the Abbe Difraction Experiment**. Through the eyepieces you can see both sets of conjugate planes at the same time.
