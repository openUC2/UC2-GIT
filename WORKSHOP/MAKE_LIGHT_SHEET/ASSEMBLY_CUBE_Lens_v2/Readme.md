# Generic Lens Holder Cube
This is the repository for the Generic Lens Holder Cube.

The STLs and links for buying parts are only provided in [APP_LIGHTSHEET_Workshop](../APP_LIGHTSHEET_Workshop) to avoid confusion.

## Purpose
Spiral holder: It adapts any circular symmetric lens with varying diameter to the UC2 system.

### Properties
* design is derived from the base-cube
* the adapter can hold a large variety of different lenses (different diameter/thickness)
* Spiral holder: the spiral automatically centers the lens to the optical axis

## Parts

### <img src="./IMAGES/P.png" height="40"> 3D printing parts
The Part consists of the following components.

* No support needed in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)


* **The Lid** where the Arduino + Electronics finds its place ([LID])
* **The Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([BASE])
* **The Objective/Lens Holder** which holds a lens with varying diameter and adapts it to the base cube ([HOLDER])


### <img src="./IMAGES/B.png" height="40"> Additional parts
* 8× DIN912 M3×12 screws (galvanized steel)
* alternatively: 4× M3×12 and 4× M3×8
* Microscope Objective lens (spiral holder) 


## <img src="./IMAGES/A.png" height="40"> Assembly of the Spiral Lens Holder
* Mount the lens inside the insert
* Put the Insert inside the Cube
* Add all screws to the Cube
* Done!

Don't touch the optical surfaces - fingerprints and scratches are bad for lenses!
